## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis can be acessed in  Microsoft Excel [download here].(https://www.microsoft.com)
## Tool Used
- Power BI
  - For Data cleaning
  - Data transformation
  - Interactive dashboard creation.
 
## Analysis Methodology
The dataset, provided as a CSV file, was loaded into Power BI, and the following steps were carried out to prepare it for analysis.
1. Data Cleaning
   - Ensured data consistency by correcting misspelled words and filling missing values using the Find and Replace function.
   - Removed unnecessary columns that were not relevant to the analysis. For instance, the "Hour" column and "Pizza Type ID" were deleted since the  "Name" column already provided the necessary information.

2. Data Transformation & Integration
   - Merged the three tables into a single table for streamlined analysis.
   - Resolved inconsistencies where columns with the same names in different tables did not match.
   - Added a calculated column to categorize time into Morning, Afternoon, and Night based on the time values.
   - Created a calendar table to support time-based analysis and ensured proper data connections in the data model.

3. Loading Data into Power BI
   - After cleaning and transforming the dataset, the Close & Apply function was used to load the final table into Power BI inorder to start my analysis.

4. Dashboard Creation
   - Developed an interactive dashboard to answer the business questions, visualizing key insights to support decision-making.
- This structured approach ensured that the dataset was well-prepared for in-depth analysis, enabling accurate insights into Pizza Pro’s sales, customer preferences, and operational efficient.

Excellent question — backing your recommendations with clear insights or data summaries is what transforms your work from opinion-based to evidence-based analysis, which hiring managers love to see in a GitHub portfolio.

Here’s how you can back your recommendations step-by-step:


---

1. Use Summarized Data Points

When you say something like:

> "Afternoon has more sales than morning"



Back it up with summary numbers:

### Time of Day Sales Summary

| Time of Day | Total Revenue | Orders | Quantity Sold |
|-------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Morning     | £3,406        | 202    | 209            |
| Afternoon   | £32,244       | 1,913  | 1,960          |
| Night       | £31,541       | 1,744  | 1,886          |

*Insight:* Afternoon sales generate nearly *9.5x* the revenue of morning hours, with the highest number of orders and items sold.


---

2. Add Simple Visualizations (Screenshots or Plots)

In your Power BI, take a screenshot of charts that support your recommendation and include them in your GitHub project folder.

Then, in your README.md, embed them like this:

### Top Performing Pizza Types

![Top Pizza Chart](images/top_pizza_types.png)

*Insight:* Thai Chicken, BBQ Chicken, and California Chicken pizzas dominate in revenue, accounting for over 40% of total pizza sales.


---

3. Use Percentage Comparisons

### Pizza Category Sales

| Category | Revenue | % of Total |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Chicken  | £78,000 | 38%        |
| Supreme  | £64,000 | 31%        |
| Veggie   | £34,000 | 17%        |
| Classic  | £28,000 | 14%        |

*Insight:* Chicken pizzas generate the highest revenue at 38%, nearly double that of Classic pizzas. This supports the recommendation to focus marketing and expansion on the Chicken category.


---

4. Highlight Trends in Bullet Points

### Monthly Sales Trend (Summary)
- *Highest months:* January, July, August
- *Lowest months:* February, October
- *Quarterly Trend:* Q1 has the highest total sales; Q4 the lowest.

*Recommendation Backed by Data:* Increase production and marketing in Q1 and high-performing months (Jan, Jul, Aug).


---

In Summary:

To back your recommendations:

Use data tables and percentage comparisons.

Highlight revenue, order count, and item quantity.

Add Power BI visuals as images.

Write a short 1–2 line "Insight" under each to connect the data to the business decision.
